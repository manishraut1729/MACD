Moving Average Convergence Divergence- Technical Indicator for Stock Analysis
Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.
MACD triggers technical signals when it crosses above (to buy) or below (to sell) its signal line.
MACD helps investors understand whether the bullish or bearish movement in the price is strengthening or weakening.
